# LIFO Buffer System

This is a **Verilog** code for LIFO buffer system which can store 5 numbers of 4bit each

## Design

* LIFO stands for *Last In First Out*
* Thumb rule to design a LIFO is 
   " **don't read from empty buffer and donâ€™t write to full buffer.** "
* LIFO buffer memory of depth 5 with each word 4-bit wide.
* Read and write to LIFO according to full and empty flags.
* case is preferred instead of if-else because if-else will generate parity encoder type logic and cause timing issues.
