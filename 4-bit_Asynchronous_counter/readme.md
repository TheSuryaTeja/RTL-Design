# 4-bit Asynchronous counter 

This is a **Verilog** code for 4-bit asynchronous counter using T Flip-Flop

## Design

* This is an example picture of asynchronous counter.
* It is called asynchronous because all Flip Flops donâ€™t get same clock.
* The output of T flip flop toggles for every positive edge of clock when t is high. 
  Hence it can be used in counter.
* T flip-flop is instantiated 4 times to make the 4-bit counter.
* As the counter is 4-bit, the simulation can be seen counting from 0 to 15 and it wraps around.
* We can reverse the counter (up or down) by inverting the triggering clock edge (posedge clk to negedge clk) or also by making qbar as clock for following flip flops.
