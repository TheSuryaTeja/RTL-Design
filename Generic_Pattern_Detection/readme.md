# Generic Pattern Detector

This is a **Verilog** code for detecting **any 4-digit pattern** without FSM

## Design
* Idea is to have a 4-bit register.
* Inputs pass though register from left to right.
* At every cycle we keep comparing with the pattern.
* Simple to code and scalable to any pattern and any length.
